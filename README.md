#### Loops
A  loop is used for iterating over a sequence for example;

 1 A list
 
 2 A tuple
 
 3 A dictionary
 
 4 A set 
 
 5 A string


This is less like the for keyword in other programming language, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
